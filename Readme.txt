This project draws geometric of shapes on a board a rectangle, 
triangle, square and hourglass.
The shapes are drawn based on the coordinates given by the user.
If the user will inserts validate coordinates then the shape will 
be drawn by what he has given, else there's deafault coordinates 
for the shapes. 

The main classes of this project are rectangle, 
triangle, square and hourglass, with them we'll create objects to 
be drawn on the board.
We have struct Vertex, and class utilities to help us with function to
check and create the objects.
